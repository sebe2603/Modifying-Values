# Modifying-Values
  The program is using microcontroler FRDM-KL05Z. It allows you to change the values ​​on the display. By clicking the appropriate button on the keyboard, you change the field you want to change value. The touch panel is used to change the values from 0-9. The program uses interrupt handling along with minimizing contact vibrations for buttons S2 and S4. This way, each click (no matter how long the button is pressed) changes position by one place. When we reach the extreme field on the right or left, the next click moves the cursor to the other side. Changing the value to display occurs when you touch the touch field. This panel was divided into ten fragments. By clicking closest to the left side of the panel, the digit remains on the display set to zero, the closer to the right side the value increases.
